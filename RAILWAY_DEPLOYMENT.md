# Railway Deployment Guide for Better Bible App

This guide will walk you through deploying your Better Bible App to Railway, including setting up environment variables, databases, and optimizing for production.

## üöÄ Quick Deploy to Railway

### 1. Connect Your Repository

1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Choose your Better Bible App repository
5. Railway will automatically detect it's a Next.js app

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

In your Railway project dashboard, go to the "Variables" tab and add these environment variables:

```env
# Google Gemini AI API Key
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyBX4Q3dZXzdHIoHDSHX6i5Qhp8jS01wUds

# Runway AI API Key
RUNWAY_API_KEY=Bpu5CScHECsobs0n7gJwnGLacwWOnHZv

# Runway AI Configuration
RUNWAY_MODEL=runware:101@1
RUNWAY_API_URL=https://api.runwayml.com/v1/inference

# Railway-specific variables
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
```

### 3. Add Database Service (Recommended)

For production, you'll want to replace the in-memory cache with a real database:

1. In your Railway project, click "New Service"
2. Choose "Database" ‚Üí "PostgreSQL" (or "MongoDB" if you prefer)
3. Railway will automatically add the database connection variables
4. The database will be automatically connected to your app

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Integration

### Option 1: PostgreSQL (Recommended)

Railway provides PostgreSQL with automatic connection management. Update your app to use it:

```bash
npm install @railway/postgres
```

### Option 2: MongoDB

If you prefer MongoDB:

```bash
npm install mongodb
```

### Option 3: Redis (For Caching)

For high-performance caching:

```bash
npm install redis
```

## üîß Railway-Specific Optimizations

### 1. Health Checks

Railway automatically monitors your app using the health check endpoint. The `railway.json` file is already configured for this.

### 2. Auto-Scaling

Railway can automatically scale your app based on traffic. Enable this in your service settings.

### 3. Custom Domains

Railway provides free custom domains. Set this up in your service settings.

## üìä Monitoring & Logs

### View Logs

- **Real-time logs**: View in Railway dashboard
- **Historical logs**: Access via Railway CLI

### Performance Monitoring

Railway provides built-in monitoring for:
- Response times
- Error rates
- Resource usage
- Request volume

## üîí Security Best Practices

### 1. Environment Variables

- ‚úÖ Use Railway's built-in variable management
- ‚úÖ Never commit API keys to your repository
- ‚úÖ Use different keys for development/staging/production

### 2. API Rate Limiting

Consider adding rate limiting for production:

```bash
npm install express-rate-limit
```

### 3. Content Moderation

For production use, consider adding content moderation:

```bash
npm install @azure/ai-content-safety
```

## üöÄ Production Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Environment variables configured in Railway
- [ ] Database service added and connected
- [ ] API keys are valid and have sufficient quotas
- [ ] Health checks are passing
- [ ] Custom domain configured (optional)
- [ ] Auto-scaling enabled (optional)
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured

## üîÑ Continuous Deployment

Railway automatically deploys when you push to your main branch. You can also:

1. **Manual deployments**: Trigger from Railway dashboard
2. **Preview deployments**: Create preview environments for PRs
3. **Rollback**: Quickly revert to previous deployments

## üì± Railway CLI (Optional)

Install Railway CLI for advanced management:

```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login
railway link
railway up
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**
   - Check build logs in Railway dashboard
   - Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
   - Verify Node.js version compatibility

2. **Environment Variable Issues**
   - Verify variables are set in Railway dashboard
   - Check variable names match your code
   - Ensure no typos in API keys

3. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Verify database service is running
   - Check connection variables are correct
   - Ensure database is accessible from your app

4. **API Rate Limits**
   - Monitor API usage in Railway logs
   - Implement caching to reduce API calls
   - Consider upgrading API plans if needed

### Getting Help

- **Railway Documentation**: [docs.railway.app](https://docs.railway.app)
- **Railway Discord**: [discord.gg/railway](https://discord.gg/railway)
- **GitHub Issues**: Create an issue in your repository

## üéØ Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Test all features** with your production API keys
2. **Monitor performance** and error rates
3. **Set up alerts** for critical issues
4. **Configure backup strategies** for your database
5. **Plan scaling strategies** as your user base grows

## üí∞ Cost Optimization

Railway pricing is based on usage:

- **Free tier**: Available for development
- **Pay-as-you-go**: Only pay for what you use
- **Auto-scaling**: Automatically scale down during low traffic
- **Database**: Separate pricing for database services

Monitor your usage in the Railway dashboard to optimize costs.
